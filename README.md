# Statement Exporter

- **Problem:** 3+ Years worth of digital credit card statements and no way to export all the line items to a CSV

- **Solution:** Golang and a PDF reading package (github.com/dcu/pdf) that gave me the ability to extract all the line items from the credit card statements in a CSV
